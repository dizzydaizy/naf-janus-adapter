# Networked-AFrame Janus Adapter

Network adapter for [networked-aframe](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe) that uses the Janus WebRTC server as a backend.

This adapter was designed for [Mozilla Hubs](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs) but Hubs no longer uses it. A [community fork](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-janus-adapter) with updated documentation is available in the networked-aframe organization.
